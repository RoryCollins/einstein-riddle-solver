# Einstein Riddle Solver

An Einstein Riddle is a type of puzzle where a player is given sets of options (for example red & green, or t-shirt & 
sock), as well as a series of constraints relating to those options (for example the t-shirt is not red). From these 
clues, a player is tasked with matching the options that belong together (in this example, t-shirt=green, sock=red).

`Prolog` is particularly well suited to solving constraint problems due to its predicate-based style. This makes the 
Einstein Riddle a perfect candidate for exploring Prolog

## Run
To run the application, make sure you have prolog installed and start the REPL.

From there, just run execute the following command: `solve.`
